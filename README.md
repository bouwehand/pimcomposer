composer for pimcore
====================

Integrates the [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) autoloader into pimcore. After installing, you can manage libraries with composer and use them with your pimcore installation.

Installation
------------

1. Install the plugin
2. Follow the composer/composer installation instructions to install libraries into /vendor
3. Develop using the newly installed libraries

Example
-------

We want to use Symfony's console component. First, create a `composer.json` file specifying the dependency.

    ``` json
    {
        "require": {
            "symfony/console": "*"
        }
    }
    ```

Install composer if you don't have done so yet.

    ``` sh
    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    ```

Use composer to install the needed component(s) into `/vendor` and create an autoloader file we can use later.

    ``` sh
    $ php composer.phar install
    ```

Use the library in your project.

    ``` php
    <?php
    class ExampleCommand extends Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command
    {
        // do fancy stuff here
    }
    ```
